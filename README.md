# GitHub Deployer Service

This is a Node.js web application that allows users to connect their GitHub accounts, view their repositories, and simulate deploying them. It's designed to be a basic framework for a GitHub-integrated deployment tool.

The application features a futuristic-themed dark UI.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14.x or later recommended)
- npm (usually comes with Node.js)
- A GitHub account
- A GitHub OAuth Application

## Setup Instructions

1.  **Clone the Repository** (if applicable)
    \`\`\`bash
    # git clone <repository_url>
    # cd github-deployer
    \`\`\`
    (For this environment, the files are already present.)

2.  **Install Dependencies**
    Navigate to the project directory and run:
    \`\`\`bash
    npm install
    \`\`\`

## Configuration

This application requires GitHub OAuth credentials and a session secret. It's highly recommended to configure these using environment variables.

### 1. Create a GitHub OAuth App

- Go to your GitHub account settings.
- Navigate to "Developer settings" > "OAuth Apps".
- Click "New OAuth App".
- **Application name:** Anything you like (e.g., "My Deployer App").
- **Homepage URL:** \`http://localhost:3000\` (or your deployment URL).
- **Authorization callback URL:** \`http://localhost:3000/auth/github/callback\` (or your deployment URL + \`/auth/github/callback\`).
- After creation, you will get a **Client ID** and generate a **Client Secret**.

### 2. Set Environment Variables

Create a \`.env\` file in the root of your project (optional, for local development if you use a library like \`dotenv\`) or set the environment variables directly in your shell or deployment environment:

\`\`\`
GITHUB_CLIENT_ID="YOUR_GITHUB_APP_CLIENT_ID"
GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET="YOUR_GITHUB_APP_CLIENT_SECRET"
SESSION_SECRET="A_VERY_STRONG_RANDOM_STRING_FOR_SESSIONS"
PORT="3000" # Optional, defaults to 3000
# NODE_ENV="production" # Optional, set to production for secure cookies
\`\`\`

- Replace placeholders with your actual GitHub OAuth App Client ID, Client Secret, and a strong random string for the session secret.
- The application includes fallback credentials for convenience during initial development, but these **should not be used for a deployed application**. You will see warnings in the console if default values are used.

## Running the Application

Once dependencies are installed and environment variables are set:

1.  **Start the server:**
    \`\`\`bash
    npm start
    \`\`\`
    This will typically run the command \`node app.js\`.

2.  **Access the application:**
    Open your web browser and go to \`http://localhost:3000\` (or the port you configured).

## Usage

1.  On the homepage, click "Login with GitHub".
2.  You will be redirected to GitHub to authorize the application.
3.  After authorization, you will be redirected back to the application's \`/repos\` page, where a list of your GitHub repositories will be displayed.
4.  You can click the "Deploy" button next to a repository. This will simulate a deployment process with on-screen feedback.
